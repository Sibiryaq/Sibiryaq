Hello,
My name is Alexander Tolstikov. I went from a mechanic to a technologist and leading metrology engineer at a depot in Krasnoyarsk (5 years), now I am going through a similar path as a backend developer - to realize myself in what I like.
I write code in Java, in the future I plan to use Kotlin. And the fact that Java is very popular in fintech is, of course, an extra "for".

My stack:
Java  
Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Security  
JDBC, Hibernate, Flyway  
Junit, Mockito, Testcontainers  
PostgreSQL  
Kafka  
Docker, Maven  

Some of my projects are pinned below. Hope you find ones interesting.  
Have you any idea or question, please contact me via Telegram [@sibiryaq](https://t.me/sibiryaq).
